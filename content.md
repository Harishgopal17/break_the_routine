### Plain information on how planing a day is important

- Most of us understand the value of planning and preparation. A sports match without a game plan means fumbling on the field. A big event without all the details in place leads to chaos.

- James Clear, the best-selling author of Atomic Habits, thinks motivation is overrated: “Stop waiting for motivation or inspiration to strike you and set a schedule for your habits”. Motivation flows from action, not the other way around.

- That’s why having a daily planning ritual is so important. Some mornings we feel motivated to seize the day and create a to-do list that reflects our big ambitions. But those days are the exception. We need to get things done even when we wake up tired and disengaged, wanting to return to bed or longing for Friday at 5 PM. Those are the days it’s most important to approach the day with a new plan.

### How breaking your routine can help you

- Reduced Stress and Anxiety: Following the same routine day in and day out can lead to feelings of monotony and stagnation, which in turn can contribute to increased stress and anxiety. Breaking routine introduces novelty and variety into one's life, providing a refreshing change of pace that can help alleviate stress and promote relaxation.

- Enhanced Mood and Well-Being: Engaging in new and different activities stimulates the brain's reward system, leading to the release of feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. This can result in improved mood and overall well-being, as individuals experience a sense of excitement, fulfillment, and satisfaction from trying something new.

- Boosted Creativity and Innovation: Routine can be stifling to creativity, as it tends to limit exposure to new experiences and ideas. By breaking routine and exposing oneself to unfamiliar situations, environments, and perspectives, individuals can stimulate their imagination, spark creativity, and cultivate innovative thinking.

- Improved Problem-Solving Skills: Breaking routine challenges individuals to think outside the box and adapt to changing circumstances, honing their problem-solving skills in the process. It encourages flexible thinking and experimentation, enabling individuals to approach challenges with creativity, resourcefulness, and resilience.

- Enhanced Personal Growth and Self-Discovery: Breaking routine facilitates personal growth and self-discovery by encouraging individuals to explore their interests, passions, and values. It provides opportunities for self-reflection, introspection, and self-expression, leading to greater self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-fulfillment.
