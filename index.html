          Most of us understand the value of planning and preparation. A sports
          match without a game plan means fumbling on the field. A big event
          without all the details in place leads to chaos.

          James Clear, the best-selling author of Atomic Habits, thinks
          motivation is overrated: “Stop waiting for motivation or inspiration
          to strike you and set a schedule for your habits”. Motivation flows
          from action, not the other way around.

        <p class="para3">
          That’s why having a daily planning ritual is so important. Some
          mornings we feel motivated to seize the day and create a to-do list
          that reflects our big ambitions. But those days are the exception. We
          need to get things done even when we wake up tired and disengaged,
          wanting to return to bed or longing for Friday at 5 PM. Those are the
          days it’s most important to approach the day with a new plan.

          <h4 class="section_heading">1. Reduced Stress and Anxiety</h4>
          <p class="section_para">
            Following the same routine day in and day out can lead to feelings
            of monotony and stagnation, which in turn can contribute to
            increased stress and anxiety. Breaking routine introduces novelty
            and variety into one's life, providing a refreshing change of pace
            that can help alleviate stress and promote relaxation.

          <h4 class="section_heading">2. Enhanced Mood and Well-Being</h4>
          <p class="section_para">
            Engaging in new and different activities stimulates the brain's
            reward system, leading to the release of feel-good neurotransmitters
            like dopamine and serotonin. This can result in improved mood and
            overall well-being, as individuals experience a sense of excitement,
            fulfillment, and satisfaction from trying something new.

          <h4 class="section_heading">3. Boosted Creativity and Innovation</h4>
          <p class="section_para">
            Routine can be stifling to creativity, as it tends to limit exposure
            to new experiences and ideas. By breaking routine and exposing
            oneself to unfamiliar situations, environments, and perspectives,
            individuals can stimulate their imagination, spark creativity, and
            cultivate innovative thinking.

          <h4 class="section_heading">4. Improved Problem-Solving Skills</h4>
          <p class="section_para">
            Breaking routine challenges individuals to think outside the box and
            adapt to changing circumstances, honing their problem-solving skills
            in the process. It encourages flexible thinking and experimentation,
            enabling individuals to approach challenges with creativity,
            resourcefulness, and resilience.

          </h4>
          <p class="section_para">
            Breaking routine facilitates personal growth and self-discovery by
            encouraging individuals to explore their interests, passions, and
            values. It provides opportunities for self-reflection,
            introspection, and self-expression, leading to greater
            self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-fulfillment.
