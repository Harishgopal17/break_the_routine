          Most of us understand the value of planning and preparation. A sports
          match without a game plan means fumbling on the field. A big event
          without all the details in place leads to chaos.

          James Clear, the best-selling author of Atomic Habits, thinks
          motivation is overrated: “Stop waiting for motivation or inspiration
          to strike you and set a schedule for your habits”. Motivation flows
          from action, not the other way around.

          That’s why having a daily planning ritual is so important. Some
          mornings we feel motivated to seize the day and create a to-do list
          that reflects our big ambitions. But those days are the exception. We
          need to get things done even when we wake up tired and disengaged,
          wanting to return to bed or longing for Friday at 5 PM. Those are the
          days it’s most important to approach the day with a new plan.

          <h4 class="section_heading">1. Reduced Stress and Anxiety</h4>
          <p class="section_para">
            Following the same routine day in and day out can lead to feelings
            of monotony and stagnation, which in turn can contribute to
            increased stress and anxiety. Breaking routine introduces novelty
            and variety into one's life, providing a refreshing change of pace
            that can help alleviate stress and promote relaxation.

          <h4 class="section_heading">2. Enhanced Mood and Well-Being</h4>
          <p class="section_para">
            Engaging in new and different activities stimulates the brain's
            reward system, leading to the release of feel-good neurotransmitters
            like dopamine and serotonin. This can result in improved mood and
            overall well-being, as individuals experience a sense of excitement,
            fulfillment, and satisfaction from trying something new.

          <h4 class="section_heading">3. Boosted Creativity and Innovation</h4>
          <p class="section_para">
            Routine can be stifling to creativity, as it tends to limit exposure
            to new experiences and ideas. By breaking routine and exposing
            oneself to unfamiliar situations, environments, and perspectives,
            individuals can stimulate their imagination, spark creativity, and
            cultivate innovative thinking.

          <h4 class="section_heading">4. Improved Problem-Solving Skills</h4>
          <p class="section_para">
            Breaking routine challenges individuals to think outside the box and
            adapt to changing circumstances, honing their problem-solving skills
            in the process. It encourages flexible thinking and experimentation,
            enabling individuals to approach challenges with creativity,
            resourcefulness, and resilience.

          </h4>
          <p class="section_para">
            Breaking routine facilitates personal growth and self-discovery by
            encouraging individuals to explore their interests, passions, and
            values. It provides opportunities for self-reflection,
            introspection, and self-expression, leading to greater
            self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-fulfillment.

            Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7 and place a baking tray on the top
            shelf. For the sauce, heat the cream and sugar until boiling. Remove
            from the heat, stir in the chocolate and butter until melted, then
            keep warm. Brush 6 x 150ml ramekins with melted butter, sprinkle
            with the 2 tbsp caster sugar, then tip out any excess. Melt the
            chocolate and cream in a bowl over a pan of simmering water, cool,
            then mix in the egg yolks. Whisk the egg whites until they hold
            their shape, then add the sugar, 1 tbsp at a time, whisking back to
            the same consistency. Mix a spoonful into the chocolate, then gently
            fold in the rest. Working quickly, fill the ramekins, wipe the rims
            clean and run your thumb around the edges. Turn oven down to
            200C/fan 180C/gas 6, place the ramekins onto the baking tray, then
            bake for 8-10 mins until risen with a slight wobble. Don’t open the
            oven door too early as this may make them collapse. Once the
            soufflés are ready, dust with icing sugar, scoop a small hole from
            their tops, then pour in some of the hot chocolate sauce. Replace
            the lids and serve straight away.
